Table cells:

name (string)
release date (date)
genre (string)
duration (HLTB) (number)
platform(s) (array)
status (array)
	- playing/replaying (replaying would be playing + played)
	- backlog
	- played
	- dropped
		- could probably treat the UI for dropped games in some way... grey out?
date(s) completed (array)
hours played (number)
number of playthroughs (number)
score (number)

Two major sections... 'played this year' and 'backlog'
	- You can choose to have both, one, or none visible. If both are visible, 2 column layout and number of columns are shortened. If only one shown, show all columns
	- Maybe have the columns fixed height and scrollable?

If you add 'playing' to a game's status, bring up a propmpt that lets you choose platform

If a game is currently in 'playing' status, add two buttons.. 'Finished it!' and 'Dropped it'
	- If you click finished it, it adds 1 to the number of playthroughs column and lets you record the # of hours you spent playing it which also adds to the hours played column
